## Overview
This is a free-and-open-source, AGPL-licensed homepage written entirely in Svelte (using the Sapper framework).
The project is in its early stages of development. As such, this README and other parts of the code should be considered as a work in progress.
It will (hopefully) replace the outdated website visitors are currently greeted with.

## Contribution guide
I've made up a certain order which development should follow. This can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), once it exists.
