# Contributing

Any contribution in our repositories always starts with an issue. Wether you're experiencing a bug, have an idea or want to suggest a feature, opening
an issue is the very first thing to do. This will allow you to gather feedback from others and is the perfect entry gate to how we automate GitOps here.
Note that as we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## It starts with an issue

1. First, check if an existing issue already addresses what you came for. You can use the GitHub issues search bar for this; don't forget to remove the 'is:open'
filter to also see closed issues from the past.
2. We do not accept support questions in the issue section; you can use other channels to ask them. They will be closed automatically and will not be read.
3. You can now open an issue. You will be presented with a handful of templates to choose from. Please fill it out as good as you can, as this
will save time later.
4. You can now wait for feedback. Bots will take care of classifying your issue, after which the issue automatically appears in its respective project board
as a card.
5. Once a contributor feels like he wants to tackle the issue, he can assign himself to it. This will automagically create an issue branch in the form of
`issue-<ISSUE-NUMBER>-<ISSUE-SUBJECT>`, ready to be pushed to.
6. Once the assigned contributor pushes to the created branch, it will automatically create a pull request with some default text. This text should be
edited/replaced with something descriptive. The pull request will, once again, be sorted into the right project board automatically.
7. Some workflows will trigger, assigning a random contributor as reviewer to the issue and attaching the issue the PR originated from to it.
8. If the PR has been merged, the issue is closed. If the PR has been closed, the issue remains untouched.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
